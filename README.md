Answers: 
Observations: 
The project definitely open up a new view of point for me and our team as a whole, now we are able to work in any scrum project as we undersatand its nature. About the idea behind the project, it was so inspiring, but the scope was very large for the 12-week timeline, so we come up with the sollution that we should break the task down into a smaller piece which will later on match with our roles perfectly, we also realized that since we are IIT engineer, we should mainly focus on developing something that relevant to our domain and left the other jobs for other major to do. Some dependencies slowed down progress, highlighting the need for better backlog refinement and prioritization. 

What went well and what should we have done to improve: 
The collaboration within the team was so good, or should i say "todella hyva" if that is the right way to say it. Every team memnbers made quick feedback from sprint reviews helped improve features,tasks were generally broken down into manageable pieces.

How well did our team succeed in estimates and sprint planning: 
Early on, estimates were overly optimistic, but velocity stabilized after a few sprints. The Sprint planning became more accurate as the team understood their capacity better. Our user Story point estimation worked well, but occasionally tasks were underestimated due to hidden complexity, sometime we just have the feeling of we were overwork the task and lost in some illusional bush but overall the final product does match our expectation. 

How was the product owner: 
Oh thats me haha, so should i estimate my work in the team as well, i think that yeah i should, sometime it is really hard to come up with any changes for the project since this is literally my first time ddoing something this big, builfing a city, if that is real it will be my legacy. So i try to put myself in the position of a customer who has spent billion of dollars on this project to have the most realistic view of how our legacy should be built, ofcause as perfect as possible 
And about my work in the team, i feel that it is better for my team to "judge" me haha. 

. What did I learn about Scrum as a project management method: 
Well, I believe that Scrum provides a structured but flexible framework for delivering increments of value. The Transparency and frequent feedback loops improve product quality and team alignment at the same time then create a strong bond between team memmbers.
